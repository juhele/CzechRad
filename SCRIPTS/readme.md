# CzechRad scripts

Here I provide scripts for working with CzechRad data. I am not a programmer, but I can do fine tuning / debugging of the scripts if AI writes them for me first. If it helps you, feel free to use the scripts published here. I cannot provide technical support for these scripts or modify them at your request. If you make any useful modifications to the script, or write a new script, please consider sharing it with other CzechRad users here. Thank you

## Supported Platform

After several negative experiences on Windows, we are creating these scripts only for GNU/Linux. It is beyond our time to determine whether the problem was in Windows or in the limitations of the corporate Windows environment... It works in Linux, the scripts can be easily deployed on a server, and anyone can set up a Linux environment on their computer for free, for example using ORACLE Virtualbox - including institutions/companies. For a lightweight installation, we recommend [current LTS version of Lubuntu Linux](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmUcpD1h](https://lubuntu.me/downloads/).

## Script 01 - find and copy all *.LOG files from "input" to "output" folder

This script scans "input" directory for *.LOG files and copies those containing "2024" inside to "output" folder. Feel free to replace "2024" with other year according to your needs.
