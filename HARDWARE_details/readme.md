## Detector unit - Geiger tube

Four different Geiger units of almost the same dimensions were considered for the device. From left to right: LND 7317 (USA) - used in Safecast devices; Saint-Gobain S800-1193 (France / India) - almost identical to the LND, but cheaper, was tested, but production discontinued during CzechRad prototype development, SPF "CONSENSUS" Gamma 6 and Gamma 6-1 (Russian Federation) - brand new design in production (not old Soviet military stock). The Gamma 6-1 was chosen for the final design.
